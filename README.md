This repo made to organize my work on the project "competetive programming".
It contains the solutions to the problems attempted by me among the weekly problems given by my mentor as a part of the project.Also, It contains my learnings so far in the pdf named "learnings".
As a part of this project I have learned the following topics.
Data Structures and their properties.
such as vector, set, pair, map, unordered_set, unordered_map and multiset. 
Sorting techniques such as
1.bubble sort 
2.insertion sort
3.merge sort
Binary Search and its applications .
greedy algorithms and their applications.
currently I am working on Dynamic Programming and applying it to various problems.
